	- Wendian – Mines’ newest machine with 87 nodes, 5 with GPUS (350+ Tflops)
* Monitors the platforms for potential issues
* Installs user software on the HPC platforms
* Installs common libraries and community codes
* Maintains documentation
* Offers consulting services to enable more effective research
* Offers workshops covering HPC topics
* Provides help porting and optimizing applications
* Provides recommendations for more effective use HPC platforms
* Represents the Mines community at HPC related conferences
* Provies consultations for advanced research computing workflows, parallel computing and more
