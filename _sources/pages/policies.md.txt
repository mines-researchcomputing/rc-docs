## HPC & Storage Rates and Best Practices

### HPC Rates (Wendian)

| **Node Type** | **Rate per hour [USD]** | **CPU core** | **Memory per CPU core [GB]** | **GPU** |
|---------------|-------------------------|--------------|------------------------------|---------|
| CPU           | $0.02                   | 1            | 5 or 10*                     | NA      |
| GPU enabled   | $0.12**                 | 6            | 48                           | 1 x NVIDIA V100  |

*Last updated: 3/31/2023*

*There are two types of CPU nodes on Wendian: (1) a "low" memory node of 192 GB, and (2) a "high" memory node of 384 GB node. Jobs will be routed to each of these nodes depending on requested resources.

**For GPU jobs, the V100 node has 4 GPU cards. For each GPU card you request, you automatically must pay for 6 CPU cores and 48 GB memory, since this is ¼ of the available compute resources on the GPU node.

### Checking HPC usage

If you would like to check your usage for a given month, we have provided some convenient commands on Wendian.

To check usage as a user, use the command `getUtilizationByUser`:

	$janedoe@wendian002:[~]: getUtilizationByUser 
	janedoe -- Cluster/Account/User Utilization 2023-04-01T00:00:00 - 2023-04-12T11:59:59 (993600 secs)
	"Account","User","Amount","Used"
	"hpcgroup","janedoe - Jane Doe",$1.23,0

To check usage as a PI for all your users, use the command `getUtilizationByPI`:
 
	pi@wendian002:[~]: getUtilizationByPI
	pi -- Cluster/Account/User Utilization 2023-04-01T00:00:00 - 2023-04-12T11:59:59 (993600 secs)
	"Account"|"User"|"Amount"
	"hpcgroup","janedoe - Jane Doe",$1.23,0
	"hpcgroup","johnsmith - John Smith",$1000.00,0

### Checking job efficiency

After a given job is complete, we have a tool installed called `reportseff` that allows one to quickly check the percent utilization of CPU and memory requested. This tool can let you check jobs for a given jobID, as well as check in a given job directory that has slurm output files.

Please refer to the GitHub page for more information: [https://github.com/troycomi/reportseff](https://github.com/troycomi/reportseff)

If you find that you are poorly utilizing CPU or memory resources, feel free to reach out to the [Mines Help Center](https://helpcenter.mines.edu) for an [HPC Consultation](https://helpcenter.mines.edu/TDClient/1946/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=30287). Job efficiency likely needs to be solved by a case by case basis, and we can serve you best this way.


 

### Storage Rates

The current storage rate policy is below:

| Storage | Rate [USD/TB] |
|-----------|------------|
| Orebits, redundant | $2.00 |

*Last updated: 03/31/2023*

 

## Data Policy

There are a few data solutions we offer at Mines for research data:

- Orebits - High capacity research storage *not* connected to HPC

The following are only on Wendian & Mio:
* `/scratch` - Active research data, subject to 180 day data purge
* `/projects` - Scratch research data used within a research project that shared with multiple users, also subject to 180 day data purge. The PI must request a projects directory with the list of authorized users.
* `/sets` - Long term data storage available on HPC. The PI must request a sets directory with a list of authorized users.
 
Note that all data on these directories have no redudancy, so please keep up with your own backups of active research data. 

Your account privileges may be suspended if we detect any attempt to evade the data purge policies (i.e. scripting the touching of files to keep them current)

The table below breaks down the purge policy and associated costs of each the data solutions:

| Type | Purge Policy | Cost | Redunancy |
|-----------|------------|---------|-------| 
| Scratch (`/scratch`) | >180 days | Free | No
| Projects (`/projects`) | >180 days | Free | No
| Wendian Long-Term Storage (`/sets`) | None | Free | No |
| Orebits | None | $2/TB/month | Yes |

> Your account privileges may be suspended if we detect any attempt to evade the data purge policies (i.e. scripting the touching of files to keep them current)

## HPC Etiquette

## Login/Management Node

When you login one of our HPC systems, you login what is known as the "management" node. This node allows one to login to HPC systems and interface with the job scheduler SLURM. Additionally, the management node can also be used to edit files, create environment and compile codes. However as a general rule, **running simulation software on the management node is prohibited.** On both HPC systems, a software called `arbiter` monitors system resources used on the login node. If you are using too many CPU resources, an automated email will be sent to you Mines E-Mail, warning you and throttling your CPU usage. Once a cooldown period ends, your CPU allotment will return to normal. 

## Scratch vs Home Directory

## Home Directory Policy

Every user has 20GB of data allocated to their `$HOME` directory. A common issue with filling this storage is conda environments. You can clean your conda packages by following [this](https://wpfiles.mines.edu/wp-content/uploads/ciarc/docs/pages/user_guides/python_environments.html#cleaning-up-conda-packages) page.    

### Scratch Policy

Files on `/scratch` (e.g. `$SCRATCH`)  is a short-term shared filesystem for storing data currently necessary for active research projects. Subject to purge on a six-month (180 day) cycle. There are no limits (within reason) to amount of data.  

## Slurm 

### Walltime Policy
The standard maximum walltime is six days (144 hours):

``
#SBATCH –time=144:00:00.
``

This policy is strictly enforced by HPC@Mines.  In the event that the computational problem you are tasked with solving seems to require a walltime that exceeds 144 hours, we strongly encourage that you find alternative approaches to simply extending walltime.  Below are two possible approaches.

#### Increase the amount of parallelism

By increasing the number of cores/nodes used in your job, you can often decrease the total wall time needed. If your code is only a single-core workload, feel free to reach out to us for a [HPC technical consultation](https://helpcenter.mines.edu/TDClient/1946/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=33487) for other workflow options.


#### Incorporate checkpointing
Checkpointing is the process of periodically saving the state of a code's program execution so that it can be resumed at a later time.  This is extremely helpful in mitigating the effects on your calculation in the event of an unexpected crash or error.  By saving output periodically, or at a certain recurring point, and being able to restart the calculation using the saved output, a catastrophic loss of an entire days-long compute effort could be avoided.  Using checkpointing to intentionally restart a calculation at a reasonably estimated point is a recommended approach to remain within the six-day maximum walltime.

For more focused computational assistance, with the above situations and other compute aspects of your research, the HPC@Mines team is available and willing to provide personal, one-on-one assistance.  Please [submit a help request](https://helpcenter.mines.edu/TDClient/1946/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=33487) to start the process.  We also suggest consulting with members of your group or other peers currently using similar codes or applications; they may provide expedited answers to your questions, based on their experience. 
 
## High-Performance Computing (HPC) Node Life Cycle

### Policy Statement
This policy outlines the support and decommissioning process for High-Performance Computing (HPC) nodes within our organization. It establishes the duration of support under a service contract, outlines the repair procedures after the contract ends, and sets the retirement timeframe of seven years for HPC nodes.

### Policy Details
1. Support under Service Contract:
    1. HPC nodes will be covered under a service contract for a specified duration, which will be determined during the procurement process. The service contract will include technical support, maintenance, and repair services.
    2. The service contract duration will be communicated to the relevant stakeholders and documented by the HPC administration team.
2. Post-Service Contract Repairs:
    1. After the service contract ends, the HPC administration team will continue to support HPC nodes for repairs if they meet the following criteria:
        1. The issue is identified as an easy fix that can be resolved without significant time, effort, or expense.
        2. The necessary parts for repair are readily available and can be obtained within a reasonable timeframe and cost.
    2. Repairs falling outside the criteria mentioned above may be considered on a case-by-case basis, subject to approval by the designated authority based on factors such as the node's importance, overall HPC system requirements, and financial considerations.
3. Retirement at Seven Years:
    1. At the seven-year mark from the date of initial deployment or purchase, HPC nodes will be decommissioned as part of the standard retirement process.
    2. The HPC administration team will coordinate the retirement process with the affected users.
    3. Upon retirement, the node will be securely removed from the HPC cluster, and any remaining components will be properly disposed of or repurposed as per applicable guidelines.
4. Exceptional Cases:
    1. In exceptional cases where repairing a node beyond the service contract period may be necessary due to critical dependencies or unique circumstances, a deviation from this policy may be considered.
    2. Exceptions to the retirement timeframe or repair criteria must be approved by the research computing manager, following a thorough evaluation and justification process.

### Review and Revision
This policy shall be reviewed periodically to ensure its effectiveness and relevance. Revisions to the policy may be made as necessary, with approval from the HPC steering committee.
