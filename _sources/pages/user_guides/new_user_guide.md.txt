# Getting Started (New User Guide)

## Introduction
In this new users guide, we will go through the basics of using the HPC systems at Mines. This includes logging into the systems via ssh, navigating the filesystem and learning how job submission works using the SLURM scheduler. If you need more help after this guide, please refer to the FAQ and User Guide pages. Additionally, you can also request help through the Mines Help Center by [submitting a ticket](https://helpcenter.mines.edu/TDClient/1946/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=4GCQlvW5OYk_&RequestorType=Service).

### Mines Gitlab Repository for Scripts

All scripts from this guide are provided on our on-site Mines Gitlab instance. 
> Note that you must be logged into the Mines VPN to gain access to the Mines Gitlab Instance. Instructions to connect to the Mines VPN are [here](https://helpcenter.mines.edu/TDClient/1946/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=133729)

To copy this directory, simply use the command

````
wget https://gitlab.mines.edu/mineshpc/hpc-job-examples/-/archive/main/hpc-job-examples-main.tar.gz
````

Then you can untar the tarball and access all files from the repository.

Alternatively, you can clone it using git:

````
git clone https://gitlab.mines.edu/mineshpc/hpc-job-examples.git
````

Note that you also get copies of our other resources, such as files from our other advanced workflows for Slurm.


## Connecting to an HPC System via SSH

### Linux and MacOS
Connecting to and using Mines’ HPC systems requires knowledge of the command line. The first step will be opening the terminal on your operating system. On Mac systems, the quickest way is to use the ‘Spotlight’ search by pressing ‘Command + Space’ on your keyboard and typing ‘Terminal’. Most Linux systems will also have a terminal app preinstalled. Once you have the terminal open, you can login using the ssh command. If you are on the Mines network, either on-campus, or connected to the Mines VPN, you can type the command

	$ ssh username@name-of-hpc-system.mines.edu

and enter your Mines Multipass password.

For example, if you have an account on Wendian and your username is janedoe,

	$ ssh janedoe@wendian.mines.edu 

Mines’ IT infrastructure allows one into Mines HPC systems through an ssh ‘jumpbox’ if you’re not connected to the Mines Network. To do so, you first need to ssh into jumpbox by typing:

	$ ssh username@pvm-jumpbox.mines.edu 
If you have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled, you will be asked for your one-time password (OTP) here as well in addition to your Mines MultiPass password. Once logged in, you can log into a Mines HPC system as normal.

### Windows
On Windows, we either recommend using mobaxterm or setting up Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) so you can follow the Linux/Mac instructions above. Note that WSL requires administrator privileges on your Windows machine to set it up. As of the April 2018 update, Windows Powershell now provides SSH by default.


## Introduction to Command Line and Filesystem
In this section, we will go through the basics of how to use the command line to navigate the filesystem. We will also briefly describe aspects of the filesystem that are important to keep your work organized and adhere to HPC policy.

### Filesystem Basics
For both HPC systems, there is a basic filesystem structure with designated paths for various types of files. Upon login to either Wendian or Mio, typing ls, you should see the following too directories: bins and scratch.

	Useful Environment Variables
	Directory 	Environmental variable
	Home directory 	$HOME
	$HOME/bins 	$BINS
	$HOME/scratch 	$SCRATCH

Your home directory is where you can store any personal files, scripts, and programs that you need to keep long term. The bins is a place to store compiled programs and executables that you need to run for jobs. As the name implies, scratch is the scratch directory used for temporary files needed for running jobs.

>It is HPC policy to make sure that job data is run under your scratch directory. Users who do not follow this may receive notice or warnings from HPC staff.

### Command Line Basics for Navigating the Filesystem
In order to manage, edit and run files on an HPC system, you will need to learn the basics of the Unix/Linux command line. There are many guides online on learning how to do this, but we will provide some basic commands in the tables below. For more information, please take a look at the guides mentioned below:

* Ubuntu Command Line For Beginners Guide
* Oracle Advanced Linux Command Mastery

The table below summarizes all the basic commands you need to navigaate the file system:

Command | Description |
---|---|
`ls -lah` |	shows list (`-l`) of all files/directories, including hidden ones (`-a`), in current directory with human-readable (`-h`) file sizes |
`pwd` |	prints out the path of the current working directory |
`cd`    |	changes your directory to your home directory (on most Linux/Mac machines, this will be `/home/username`) |
`cd ..` |	changes your directory down one directory on the path, e.g. if you're at `/home/username, "`cd ..`" will take you to `/home` |
`cd $directory-path` |	changes to directory at `$directory-path` |
`mkdir $directory-name` |	creates a directory in your current working directory called `$directory-name` |
`mkdir -p $directory-path` |	creates a directory located at `$directory-path` (e.g. `$directory-path="/home/Documents/"` would move you to `/home/Documents` as your current working directory) |
`cp $filename $new_file_location` |	copies `$filename` (e.g. `$filename="/home/Documents/foo.txt"` would copy the file to `$new_file_location` (e.g. `$new_file_location="/home/Documents/New/foo.txt")` |
`mv $filename $new_file_location` |	moves `$filename` (e.g. `$filename="/home/Documents/foo.txt"` would copy the file to `$new_file_location` (e.g. `$new_file_location="/home/Documents/New/foo.txt")` |

### Choosing a text editor
When using the command line, a text editor becomes a powerful tool to create and edit job scripts, as well as modify codes on the system. There are 3 text editors that we recommend:

* nano – recommended for beginners new to command line-based text editors. A guide and shortcuts can be found on their website.
* vim – A keyboard-centric highly customizable text editor. Recommended for advanced users who want to customize how they edit their files on the commandline. Documentation can be found here.
* emacs – Another power user-friendly text editor. Documentation can be found here.

## Running Jobs

### Slurm: HPC Job Scheduler
Access to compute resources on Mines’ HPC platforms in managed through a job scheduler. The job scheduler manages HPC resources by having users send jobs using scripts, asking for resources, what commands to run, and how to run them. The scheduler will launch the script on compute resources when they are available. The script consists of two parts, instructions for the scheduler and the commands that the user wants to run.

A sample script is shown below:

	#!/bin/bash
	#SBATCH --job-name="sample"
	#SBATCH --nodes=2
	#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=4
	#SBATCH --ntasks=8
	#SBATCH --export=ALL
	#SBATCH --time=01:00:00

	cd $SCRATCH
	ls > myfiles
	srun hostname
	
The lines that begin with `#SBATCH` are instructions to the scheduler. In order:

1. `#SBATCH –-job-name=”sample”` – You are naming the job
2. `#SBATCH –-nodes=2` – You are telling the scheduler that you want to run on two nodes
3. `#SBATCH –-ntasks-per-node=4` – You want to run four tasks per node for a total of 8 tasks. (The —ntasks-per-node line is redundant in this case.)
5. `#SBATCH –-export=ALL` – All your environmental variables setting will passed to the compute nodes.
6. `#SBATCH –-time=01:00:00` – You will run no longer than 1 hr.

The last three lines are normal shell commands:

7. `cd $SCRATCH` – You will be put in your scratch directory.
8. `ls > myfiles` – A directory listing will be put in the file myfiles.
9. `srun hostname` – The srun command will launch the program hostname in parallel, in this case 8 copies will be started simultaneously. Note that the ls command is not run in parallel; only a single instance will be launched.

The script is launched using the `sbatch` command. By default the standard output and standard error will be put in files with the names `slurm-######.out` and `slurm-######.err` respectively, where `######` is a job number. For example running this script on Wendian produces:

	[username@wendian001 ~]$ sbatch dohost
	Submitted batch job 363541
	After some time…

	[username@wendian001 ~]$ ls -lt | head
	total 88120
	-rw-rw-r--  1 username username        64 Sep 24 16:28 slurm-363541.out
	-rw-rw-r--  1 username username      2321 Sep 24 16:28 myfiles
	...

	[username@wendian001 ~]$ cat slurm-363541.out
	c001
	c002
	c001
	c001
	c001
	c002
	c002
	c002

There are several user level commands available for managing jobs on the HPC resources. These are discussed briefly by the **How do I manage jobs?** on the HPC FAQs page.

### Slurm Job Management and Policy
SLURM manages job priority based on variety of factors, including but not limited to: resources requested (number of nodes, memory, etc), length of job time, and prior number of jobs submitted. Mio and Wendian both have their own job policies, which you can learn more about on our FAQ page.

### Running your first compiled job - Hello World! 
Now that you can login, navigate the filesystem and understand the basics of the SLURM job scheduler, we are ready to send our first job to the scheduler. For the first example, we are going to show how to send a job using the simple C++ program for “Hello World”:

	// Source: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/cpp-tutorial-hello-world/
	#include "stdio.h"
	int main()
	{
	  std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
	  return 0;
	}

For this program hello_world.cpp, we can compile it using the system’s C++ compiler g++:

	$ g++ hello_world.cpp -o hello_world.exe

Now, to send this job using a job script, we need to write one using the SLURM preamble definitions. A sample job script `run.slurm` for our Hello Program is below:

	#!/bin/bash
	#SBATCH --nodes=1 # number of nodes
	#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1 # number of tasks per node
	#SBATCH --ntasks=1 # redundant; total number of tasks: ntasks = nodes * ntasks-per-node
	#SBATCH --time=00:00:01 # time in HH:MM:SS
	#SBATCH -o output.%j # standard print output labeled with SLURM job id %j
	#SBATCH -e error.%j  # standard print error  labeled with SLURM job id %j

	echo "Job has started!"
	srun hello_world.exe
	echo "Job has finished!"

We will highlight some aspects of this SLURM script. First, the lines starting with `#SBATCH` are part of a SLURM script’s preamble. There are a multitude of options for the preamble, where you read more about on the SLURM sbatch documentation page here.

The command srun tells SLURM what executable to run (in this case hello_world) and how to run it using all the SLURM preamble options above.

>NOTE: For most cases, it is required to send your job’s executable using srun. There are a few exceptions for this rule and will be advised on a case by case basis.

Now to send the job to SLURM we use `sbatch`:

	$ sbatch run.slurm

You should see the following printed to the screen:

	Submitted batch job $JOB_ID
where `$JOB_ID` will look something like `5711043`.

## An Introduction to the Module System

Software required for high performance computing is complex due to its web of dependencies of libraries and other scientifc software programs. Furthermore, each piece of scientific software may require dependencies that may conflict with existing libraries, or require a different version of a library completely. Hence, a modular system allows one to load and unload dependencies as needed, depending on what is required from the software.

On Linux systems, paths for software and their libraries are determined by setting environmental variables. You can see the settings of all variables by running the command printenv. In most cases, the most important environment variables are `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. `PATH` is an environment variable that sets a list of directories that can be searched for finding applications. Similarly, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` defines a list of directories that will be searched to find libraries used by applications. If you enter a command and see “command not found” then it is possible the directory containing the application is not in `PATH`; a similar error occurs for `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` when it cannot find a required library. The module system is designed to easily set and unset collections of environment variables. On Mines HPC systems, this is done using the lmod module system. We will briefly describe some common important module commands and also how to use it in context of setting up and submitting a job.

### Important Module commands
* `module spider` – Lists all available modules in a cascading tree format
* `module -r spider mpi` – Lists all modules related to “mpi” in a cascading tree format
* `module keyword gromacs` – List modules related to the gromacs program
* `module load apps/gromacs/gcc-ompi-plumed/2021.1` – Loads the Gromacs 2021.1 module
* `module unload apps/gromacs/gcc-ompi-plumed/2021.1` – Unloads the Gromacs 2021.1 module
* `module purge` – Unloads all currenty loaded modules
* `module list` – Lists all currently loaded modules
Not all applications are accessible by all HPC users. Some codes are commercial and require licensing, and hence PI approval. Some require PI approval for other reasons. If you are unable to load a module, or see permission errors when executing a job, and would like to know how you might obtain access, please submit a help request.

Some modules have dependencies that need to be manually entered. For example, the gromacs module requires that modules for the compiler and MPI be loaded first. If there is an unsatisfied dependency you will be notified.

## Running jobs with modules

### Hello World! Using MPI
	// Reference:  https://mpi.deino.net/mpi_functions/MPI_Init.html
	#include "mpi.h"
	#include "stdio.h"
	using namespace std;
	int main(int argc, char* argv[])
	{
	int rank, np;
	MPI_Init(&argc,&argv); // initialize MPI
	MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &np); // get total number of processors
	MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank); // get current rank  
	cout << "Hello World from rank " << rank << " out of " << np << " processors!" << endl;
	MPI_Finalize(); // finalize MPI
	return 0;
	}
For the second program, we wanted to demonstrate how to use the system’s module system. This program initializes MPI, defines integer variables to store the number of processors np and the current processor/”rank”, rank, and then prints “Hello World from rank rank out of np processors!”, followed by finalizing MPI.

To compile this code, we need to load modules from the module system.

On Wendian:

	$ module load compilers/gcc/9.3.1 mpi/openmpi/gcc-cuda/4.1.4
On Mio:

	$ module load compilers/gcc/9 mpi/openmpi/gcc/4.1.1
This will load a newer GCC compiler that is required for our OpenMPI library we’re going to use with the code. To compile the code, we will use the MPI-wrapped C++ compiler mpicxx:

	$ mpicxx  hello_world.cpp -o hello_world.exe
A sample job script (which we will call run.slurm) to use the executable will look like:

	#!/bin/bash
	#SBATCH --nodes=1 # number of nodes
	#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=12 # number of tasks per node
	#SBATCH --ntasks=12 # redundant; total number of tasks: ntasks = nodes * ntasks-per-node
	#SBATCH --time=00:00:01 # time in HH:MM:SS
	#SBATCH -o output.%j # standard print output labeled with SLURM job id %j
	#SBATCH -e error.%j  # standard print error  labeled with SLURM job id %j

	# If on Wendian, uncomment the line below
	module load compilers/gcc/9.3.1 mpi/openmpi/gcc-cuda/4.1.4
	# If on Mio, uncomment the line below
	# module load compilers/gcc/9 mpi/openmpi/gcc/4.1.1

	echo "Job has started!"
	srun hello_world.exe
	echo "Job has finished!
As with the last example, we can send the job to the scheduler using the command:

	$ sbatch run.slurm
When the job completes, you should see an output file called `output.%j` where `%j` is the job ID. The output for this job should look similar to:

	Job has started!
	Hello, World! from rank 1 out of 12 processors!
	Hello, World! from rank 3 out of 12 processors!
	Hello, World! from rank 5 out of 12 processors!
	Hello, World! from rank 7 out of 12 processors!
	Hello, World! from rank 9 out of 12 processors!
	Hello, World! from rank 10 out of 12 processors!
	Hello, World! from rank 11 out of 12 processors!
	Hello, World! from rank 0 out of 12 processors!
	Hello, World! from rank 2 out of 12 processors!
	Hello, World! from rank 4 out of 12 processors!
	Hello, World! from rank 6 out of 12 processors!
	Hello, World! from rank 8 out of 12 processors!
	Job has finished!  


### [OPTIONAL] Using Python
For many cases, Python is a popular scientific computing program language with a large library of modules to choose from. There are so many dependencies that managing python modules through the HPC module system alone would become incredibly cumbersome. As an alternative, we recommend HPC users take control of the python modules they need by creating their own environment using Anaconda. We will briefly go over how to do this below.

Python v2.7 was deprecated at the beginning of 2020 which means that it will no longer be updated. Linux operating systems, such as the ones used on Mines HPC systems, while currently supported, will eventually not include Python 2.7 by default. We encourage researchers to make the transition to Python 3.x as soon as they are able.

#### Creating your own environment using Anaconda
First step is to load the desired version Python version. We will show examples for both Wendian and Mio below.

On Wendian and Mio

	$ module load apps/python3/2022.10

Then create your own python environment using the following command:

	$ conda create --name my_env python=3.7
You should see something similiar to the following print to the screen:

	Collecting package metadata (current_repodata.json): done
	Solving environment: done

	ca-certificates    pkgs/main::ca-certificates-2021.1.19-~ --> conda-forge::ca-certificates-2020.12.5-ha878542_0


	Proceed ([y]/n)?
	Confirm by typing ‘y’ and pressing enter. You now should have your own Python environment with petsc4py!

#### Deactivating your conda environment
Once you are done with your environment, you can disable it by issuing the command:

	$ conda deactivate
#### Running Python with Slurm
We will now use this conda environment to submit a job to SLURM. The example problem is called `my_petsc4py.py`:

	import sys
	import petsc4py
	petsc4py.init(sys.argv)
	from petsc4py import PETSc

	# store MPI rank and size using PETSc's MPI COMM WORLD
	rank = PETSc.COMM_WORLD.Get_rank()
	size = PETSc.COMM_WORLD.Get_size()

	print("This print statement is coming from rank ", rank, "out of ", size, " processors")
This simple python script will initialize PETSc environment, collect the current MPI rank and number of processors and print them based on their rank. This should look similiar to our Hello World! using MPI example above.

Next, we need to setup a SLURM script, which we call run.sh:

	#!/bin/bash
	#SBATCH --nodes=1 # number of nodes
	#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=12 # number of tasks per node
	#SBATCH --ntasks=12 # redundant; total number of tasks: ntasks = nodes * ntasks-per-node
	#SBATCH --time=00:00:01 # time in HH:MM:SS
	#SBATCH -o output.%j # standard print output labeled with SLURM job id %j
	#SBATCH -e error.%j  # standard print error  labeled with SLURM job id %j

	# load python module
	module load apps/python3/2020.02

	# activate conda environment required to run code
	source activate my_env

	echo "Job has started!"
	srun python my_petsc4py.py
	echo "Job has finished!
Similiar to before, we can submit this to the SLURM scheduler by using the command:

	$ sbatch run.sh 
When the job finishes, your output file should look like:

	Job has started!
	This print statement is coming from rank  0 out of  12  processors
	This print statement is coming from rank  2 out of  12  processors
	This print statement is coming from rank  1 out of  12  processors
	This print statement is coming from rank  3 out of  12  processors
	This print statement is coming from rank  4 out of  12  processors
	This print statement is coming from rank  5 out of  12  processors
	This print statement is coming from rank  6 out of  12  processors
	This print statement is coming from rank  7 out of  12  processors
	This print statement is coming from rank  8 out of  12  processors
	This print statement is coming from rank  9 out of  12  processors
	This print statement is coming from rank  10 out of  12  processors
	This print statement is coming from rank  11 out of  12  processors


## Post-processing and Visualizing Data on HPC
After your job completes, you may want to figure out how you want to post-process and visualize your data. In many cases, HPC is not necessary and many users prefer transferring their data and postprocessing & visualizating their data locally. However, you need to leverage the compute or GPU nodes to do visualization, please go to our Visualization page to learn more.

## Transferring data off HPC systems	
For transferring data off Mines HPC systems, we recommend the following command line programs: scp and rsync. Each of these commands serve a similar purpose, but function differently in practice.

The name scp stands for secure copy. The general syntax for `scp` to transfer a file from an HPC system to a local directory is as follows:

	$ scp  
For example, if you wanted to transfer the file `~/scratch/foo.txt` from Wendian to your local home directory `/home/username`, you would type (while not logged into any HPC system in your terminal):

	$ scp username@wendian.mines.edu:~/scratch/foo.txt /home/username 
Conversely, if you needed to transfer foo.txt back to Wendian, you would type:

	$ scp /home/username/foo.txt  username@wendian.mines.edu:~/scratch 
If you need to send an entire directory, scp provides the recursive flag `-r`:

	$ scp -r  /home/username/foo_bar  username@wendian.mines.edu:~/scratch 
This will transfer the directory foo_bar and its contents to ~/scartch/foo_bar

There are many other options you can use for scp, which can be found here or by typing man scp in your command line.

In some cases, you may want to transfer an entire directory, but know that many of the files in that directory haven’t changed. That is, you want to sync the files incremently based only on the files that changed. For these instances, it is recommended to use rsync. Recommended syntax for using rsync recursively is as follows:

	$ rsync --rsh=ssh -rvP username@remote_host:/path/to/source /path/to/destination
The flag --rsh=ssh ensures rsync uses ssh. -rvP will recursively pull files from the directory (`-r`), with verbose output to the screen (`-v`) and allow for partial transfers (`-P)` in case an interruption or a restart. For example, to transfer the directory foo_bar2 from Wendian to your local directory:

	$ rsync --rsh=ssh -rvP username@wendian.mines.edu:~/scratch/foo_bar2 /home/username


### Transferring files on Windows or without command line
For transferring files without the use of the command line, such as on Windows, both Mio and Wendian support the FTP protocol. For FTP transfers, we recommend Filezilla, since it is cross-platform for Windows, MacOS and Linux. 
You may also use the web portal [wendian-ondemand.mines.edu](https://wendian-ondemand.mines.edu) or [mio-ondemand.mines.edu](https://mio-ondemand.mines.edu) -> Files tab and the -> Clusters tab for Shell Access to get a terminal.
